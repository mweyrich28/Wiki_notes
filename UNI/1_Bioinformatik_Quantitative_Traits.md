# Quantitative traits & expression quantitative traits
:qts:eqts:quantitative_traits:traits:

## Quantitative Traits (QTs)
- For example: Height and blood pressure
- _*QTs*_ are determined by an interplay of environment and genetics
- They are *heritabil* 
- Their cause can be traced back to many separate loci
- *Loci*: The physical position of a gene in genome

## Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL)
Loci, that controls a quantitative trait

## Expression Quantitative Trait (eQTL)

### Polymorohism
The state of two alleles on a specific loci, where one of the alleles was caused by mutation

### Expression Quantitative Trait (eQT)
An expression QT is an amount of a mRNA transcript or Protein which can be traced back to one specific gene. In this case we can make use of the fact, that there's only one gene involved. There are also *complex QTs*, which are caused by an interplay of many unique genes.

### Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL)
- An expression quantitative trait locus describes a *chromosomal locus, which explains variance in eQTs*.
  If we were to experimentally change one of the alleles of said locus for another, we would (on average) see a change in expression.
