# Central Limit Theorem
:central_limit_theorem:normal_distribution:normalverteilung:distribution:

## Normal Distribution
$$
\boxed{f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \cdot e^{ \frac{(x - \mu)^{2}}{2 \sigma^{2}}}} 
$$

- E(x) = $\mu = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$
- Variance = $Var(x) = \sigma^{2}$

## Central Limit Theorem
> *Definition: means are normally distributed.* If we collect randoms samples of a uniformly distributed plot and calculate their mean over and over again plotting each mean in histogram, this histogram plot will follow a normal distribution (this goes for any kind of plot)
- The sum of a large number of independent random variables follows asymptotically a stable distribution 
- With finite positive variance of the random variables, the sum is approximately *normally distributed*
- Central Limit Theorem applies to sampling distributions from any population
