# Evolutionary substitution matrices
:matrices:pam:blosum:evolutionary_matrices:

## PAM (Point Accepted Mutation)
* PAM is the point mutation per 100 amino acids
* PAM1 means a 1 point mutation per 100 amino acids
» Based on *global alignments:* [1_Bioinformatik_Needleman_Wunsch_Algorithm](1_Bioinformatik_Needleman_Wunsch_Algorithm)

## BLOSUM (Blocks substitution matrix)
* BLOSUM matrices are newer and considered better 
* BLOSUM62 is the matrix calculated by using the observed substitutions between proteins which have at most 62% sequence identity 
» Based on *local alignments:* [1_Bioinformatik_Smith_Waterman_Algorithm](1_Bioinformatik_Smith_Waterman_Algorithm)
