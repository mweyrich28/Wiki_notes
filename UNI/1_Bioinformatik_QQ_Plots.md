# QQ-Plots
:qq_plots:statistic:

## Purpose
*â†’ Determine if two datasets come from populations with a common distribution*
- We plot the quantiles of the first data set against the quantiles of the second data set
- We also plot a 45 degree reference line, then if the tow sets come from a population with the same distribution, 
  the points should fall approximately on that line
- The greater the departure from the line, the greater the evidence for the conclusion that the two datasets have come from different populations

## Advantages
- Sample sizes don't have to be equal
- Many distributional aspects can be simultaneously tested:
	- shifts in location
	- shifts in scale
	- changes in symmetry
	- the presence of outliers can be detected from this plot
