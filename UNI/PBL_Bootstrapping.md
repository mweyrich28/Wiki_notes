Bootstrapping is a statistical resampling method used to estimate the standard error of a model's performance metrics. The steps are as follows:

1. **Split Data**: Divide the dataset into a training set and a hold-out set.
2. **Train Model**: Train the model using the training set.
3. **Initial Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the hold-out set to get initial performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).
4. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Resample $n$ instances from the hold-out set with replacement to form one bootstrap sample.
5. **Evaluate Metrics**: Use the model to evaluate performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) on each bootstrap sample.
6. **Repeat**: Perform steps 4-5 for $B$ times, where $B$ is the number of bootstrap samples.
7. **Calculate Standard Error**: Compute the standard error (SE) of the performance metrics using the formula:
$$
\text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{i=1}^{B} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$
Here, $x_i$ is the performance metric for the $i^{th}$ bootstrap sample, and $\bar{x}$ is the average performance metric across all $B$ samples.

This approach allows you to estimate the variability in your model's performance, offering a more robust evaluation.
